# An R Companion to Applied Regression

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of [An
R Companion to Applied
Regression](https://www.john-fox.ca/Companion/index.html) by John Fox
and Sandford Weisberg \[@fox2018\].

WATCH OUT: This is my personal learning material and is therefore
neither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.

I am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces
me to become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more
carefully. Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an
expert but by a learner.
