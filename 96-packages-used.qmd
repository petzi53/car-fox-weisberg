:::
An R Companion to Applied Regression is a broad introduction to the R statistical computing environment in the context of applied regression analysis. The book provides a step-by-step guide to using the free statistical software R, and emphasizes integrating statistical computing in R with the practice of data analysis.  The R packages car and effects, written to facilitate the application and interpretation of regression analysis, are extensively covered in the book.

Add glossaries to markdown and quarto documents by tagging individual words. Definitions can be provided inline or in a separate file.


:::

There is a lot of necessary jargon to learn for coding. The goal of glossary is to provide a lightweight solution for making glossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown. This package provides functions to link terms in text to their definitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary table of all linked terms at the end of a section.
