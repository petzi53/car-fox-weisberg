It returns a character vector giving the names of objects in the search list matching (as a regular expression)\n- `utils:find('<searchString>')` returns where objects of a given name can be found.\n- `??` or `help.search()` activates a broader search because it looks not only in the title fields but in other fields of the help pages as well.\n- `utils::RSiteSearch()` or the search engine at https://search.r-project.org/ needs an internet connection and starts a search even broader. It looks in all standard and CRAN packages, even those not installed on your system.\n- [CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) describe\tresources in R for applications in specific areas.\n    - Views can be installed automatically via ctv::install.views(\"Bayesian\") or ctv::update.views(\"Bayesian\", coreOnly=TRUE)\n    - Query information about a particular task view on CRAN from within R for example with `ctv::ctv(\"MachineLearning\")`\n    - Query to obtain the list of all task views available with `ctv::available.views()`\n- `help(package='<packageName>')` calls the index help page of an installed package in the RStudio Help tab, including the hyperlinked index of help topics documented in the package.\n- <a class='glossary' title='A vignette is a long-form guide to your package. (Chapter Vignettes in R Packages 2e)'>Vignette</a>:\n    - `utils::vignette()` lists available vignettes in the packages installed on your system in the code window. \n    - `utils::browseVignettes()` open a local web page listing vignettes in the packages installed on your system\n    - `utils::vignette(package='<packageName>')` displays the vignettes available in a particular installed package. \n    - `vignette('vignetteName')` or vignette('<vignetteName>', package='<packageName>') opens a specific vignette.\n- *RStudio help*: \n    - Menu \"Help > R Help\" opens  an overview page with R resources\n    - Search R help with shortcut CTRL-ALT-F1\n    - [Finding your way to R](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/) with three learning pathes: [Beginners](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/), [Intermediates](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/intermediate/) and [Experts](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/expert/)\n- Google search\n- <a class='glossary' title='Stack Overflow is a question-and-answer website for computer programmers.
